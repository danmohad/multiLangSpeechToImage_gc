# Multi-language speech-to-image notebook using Google Cloud and DeepAI
This is a speech-to-image notebook written using Google Cloud `speech` and `translate` APIs and DeepAI `stable-diffusion` image generation API. Any of the [supported](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/languages) languages can be spoken and recorded natively, and will be used to generate images. Since most AI image generation APIs expect English-language input, here speech is transcribed in the spoken language, then translated to English, and then used to generate images.
